   ```sql
   SELECT type, COUNT(*) AS no_of_shows FROM netflix GROUP BY type;
   ```

2. **Most Common Rating for Movies and TV Shows**
   ```sql
   SELECT type, rating, COUNT(*) AS no_of_shows FROM netflix GROUP BY type, rating ORDER BY type, no_of_shows DESC;
   ```

3. **List All Movies Released in 2020**

   SELECT title, release_year FROM netflix WHERE release_year = 2020 AND type = 'Movie';
   ```

4. **Top 5 Countries with Most Content on Netflix**
   ```sql
   SELECT unnest(string_to_array(country, ',')) AS new_country, COUNT(*) AS no_of_shows FROM netflix GROUP BY new_country ORDER BY no_of_shows DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```

5. **Identify the Longest Movie**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM netflix WHERE type = 'Movie' AND duration = (SELECT MAX(duration) FROM netflix);
   ```

6. **Content Added in the Last 5 Years**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM netflix WHERE to_date(date_added,'Month DD,YYYY') >= current_date - INTERVAL '5 years';
   ```

7. **All Content by Director 'Rajiv Chilaka'**

   SELECT * FROM netflix WHERE director ILIKE '%Rajiv Chilaka%';
   ```

8. **TV Shows with More Than 5 Seasons**

   SELECT * FROM netflix WHERE type = 'TV Show' AND split_part(duration, ' ', 1)::numeric > 5;
   ```

9. **Count Content Items in Each Genre**
   ```sql
   SELECT unnest(string_to_array(listed_in, ',')) AS genre, COUNT(show_id) FROM netflix GROUP BY genre;
   ```

10. **Top 5 Years with Highest Average Content Released in India**
    ```sql
    SELECT extract(year from to_date(date_added,'Month DD,YYYY')) AS year, COUNT(*) AS total, COUNT(*)::numeric / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM netflix WHERE country = 'India')::numeric * 100 AS avg_per_year FROM netflix WHERE country = 'India' GROUP BY year ORDER BY avg_per_year DESC LIMIT 5;
    ```

11. **Documentary Movies**
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM netflix WHERE listed_in ILIKE '%Documentaries%' AND type = 'Movie';
    ```

12. **Content Without a Director**

    ```

14. **Top Actors in Indian Content**
    ```sql
    SELECT unnest(string_to_array(casts, ',')) AS actor, COUNT(show_id) FROM netflix WHERE country ILIKE '%India%' GROUP BY actor ORDER BY COUNT(show_id) DESC;
    ```

15. **Categorize Content as 'BAD' or 'GOOD' Based on Keywords**
    ```sql
    WITH categorized AS (
      SELECT *, CASE
        WHEN description ILIKE '%kill%' THEN 'BAD'
        WHEN description ILIKE '%violence%' THEN 'BAD'
        ELSE 'GOOD'
      END AS category FROM netflix
    )
    SELECT category, COUNT(show_id) FROM categorized GROUP BY category;
    ```
